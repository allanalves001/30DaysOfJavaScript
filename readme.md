### Information

If you want to understand the exercises, it is recommended that you check the course since I didn't add the instructions for each exercise here.

The file practice.js is the file that I used to load the JS code from that respective day. Once past, the exercise becomes file 'day-1.js'. 'day-2.js' and so on.
